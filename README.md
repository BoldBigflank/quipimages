Quiplash "Tweet this" images
============================

This contains the logic to create a shareable image of Quiplash prompts and choices.

## To add a "Tweet this" link to your client

## How it works:

Any text can be added to the image, by going to `/images/?prompt=prompt&choice=left&choice=right`

`/images/tweet?prompt=prompt&choice=left&choice=right` will show you a preview of a tweet that you can modify and send using your authorized twitter account.
Going through the authorization process is only necessary the first time.
